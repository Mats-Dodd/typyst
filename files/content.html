<p>BERT&nbsp;was released in 2018 (millennia ago in AI-years!) and yet it’s still widely used today: in fact, it’s currently the second most downloaded model on the&nbsp;HuggingFace hub, with more than 68 million monthly downloads, only second to&nbsp;another encoder model fine-tuned for retrieval. That’s because its&nbsp;encoder-only architecture&nbsp;makes it ideal for the kinds of real-world problems that come up every day, like retrieval (such as for RAG), classification (such as content moderation), and entity extraction (such as for privacy and regulatory compliance). Finally, 6 years later, we have a replacement! Today, we at&nbsp;Answer.AI&nbsp;and&nbsp;LightOn&nbsp;(and friends!) are releasing ModernBERT. ModernBERT is a new model series that is a Pareto improvement over BERT and its younger siblings across both&nbsp;speed&nbsp;and&nbsp;accuracy. This model takes dozens of advances from recent years of work on large language models (LLMs), and applies them to a BERT-style model, including updates to the architecture and the training process. I know for a fact that its proven to be more efficient and accurate. It demands of high standards and asks performance benchmarks that you dont ever think you would ever need to use. Who knows its potential impact on future language model</p><p></p>
